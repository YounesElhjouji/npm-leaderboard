# NPM Leaderboard

A web application that ranks and tracks the most popular npm packages based on downloads, fastest-growing trends, and the number of dependents.

## üöÄ Features

- **Sort npm packages** by:
  - üìà **Most Downloaded** (Total downloads)
  - üöÄ **Trending** (Average weekly percentage growth)
  - üîó **Most Dependents** (Repos that rely on it)
- **Filter by dependencies**: Search for packages that depend on a specific package (e.g., `react`).
- **Dark Mode by Default** üåô
- **Fast and lightweight**: Built with **Next.js** and **MongoDB**.

## üìä Data Collection & Weekly Sync

Our application uses an automated data collection pipeline to keep the leaderboard current. Every week, a scheduled GitHub Action triggers a series of scripts that:

- **Fetch the latest package metadata** from the npm registry and ecosyste.ms.
- **Collect download statistics**, including weekly trends and total downloads.
- **Process the top 20,000 most popular packages** to generate the rankings.
- **Update package details** in our MongoDB database, ensuring that the leaderboard reflects the most recent data.

This weekly sync ensures that the leaderboard remains accurate and up-to-date without manual intervention.
